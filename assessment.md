**Feedback on Assessment Submission:**

**Instructions:**
- Your instructions were clear and detailed. They could be followed using simple copy/paste functionality, and you added them as a README.md file. Additionally, you included your reflection about the assessment, which goes above and beyond.

**Code Structure and Comments:**
- The code featured sufficient comments, aiding in understanding. You effectively segregated significant computations into separate methods, which is commendable. Additionally, you maintained consistent code formatting and indentation throughout. However, the code did not utilize the object-oriented programming methodology, which could have further enhanced its structure and readability.

**Functionality:**
- The functionality of your software was impressive. You went above and beyond by choosing to develop a full-featured graphical user interface rather than a simple command-line user interface. Your robot did not go beyond the prescribed grid area and navigate in an intuitive manner from left to right according to the array keys. However, the functionality for moving backwards and forwards was unfortunately inverted.
Regarding dependencies, you proceeded correctly by choosing to run the code in a virtual environment (venv) and having a requirements.txt file. However, I had to spend a significant amount of time fixing dependency issues. For instance, tkinter was not listed as a dependency and therefore was not installed automatically. It's always best to thoroughly test your full software implementation before delivering it. Additionally, creating tests for your code is commendable and goes above and beyond.

**Input Handling:**
- You bypassed the issue of input handling by creating your own GUI, well done.

**Overall Evaluation:**
- Overall I was impressed by your submission. You went above and beyond to deliver a solution that satisfies your own, improved requirements and delivered the solution according to the field best practices (aside from sending via email originally). The fact that you thought of dependencies and tests shows that you have a strong software dev background. Well done.
